#  Rotates a simple 2D FITS image. If <xcen> and <ycen> are specified,
#  the output image is the same size as the input image. Otherwise,
#  the output image is the smallest that will hold all the rotated input
#  data.

#  Usage:
#    rotate_wcs.py <infile> <outfile> <angle> [<xcen> <ycen>]
#
#    <infile> = Input fits file
#    <outfile> = Output fits file
#    <angle> = angle of rotation in degrees
#    <xcen> = Optional - the X pixel at the centre of rotation
#    <ycen> = Optional - the Y pixel at the centre of rotation

#  Notes:
#     - Requires pyast version 2.3
